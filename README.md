### Neural-Networks  
Repository covering topics discussed throughout the *Topics in Statistics - Neural Networks* course.

- **'neural_net_from_scratch'**: Details the implementation of a neural network without using libraries that would simplify the process.

- **'Regularization'**: Discusses the implementation of *Dropout* and the use of Keras to aid in constructing complex and parsimonious neural network structures through Bayesian optimization assisted by a Gaussian process.

- **'Optimizers'**: Methods of optimization are implemented entirely from scratch without the use of libraries.
